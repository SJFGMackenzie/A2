        <h2>Interview with an IT Professional</h2>
        <p>Interview conducted by Thomas Kauran and Jo Stammers.</p>
        <span>Documented by Stephen MacKenzie.</span>
        <h3>Interview</h3>
        <p>
          We interviewed an IT professional to find out what is involved in the day-to-day activities carried out by someone who works in an IT industry. Jo sent Alex a message asking if he would be available to do an interview for our group, to which he excitedly replied with 'yes'. We organised the interview to be conducted by Thomas and Jo, with Stephan  taking notes and dictation. Stephan then wrote up the documentation, which was further edited by Jo in reports finalization.
        </p>
        <h3>Interview Transcript</h3>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"Hi Alex, thank you for doing this with us today.</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "I'm happy to be doing it, it's the first time I've been asked to do this on a professional level so I'm actually quite excited."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"Can you please tell us about your job in IT? What exactly is it you do?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "My official job title is Senior Full Stack Security Engineer, although I have many other roles, as do most IT professionals. I work in back-end security, penetration testing and security analytics."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Thomas]: <strong>"The next question we have for you is, what made you choose your career direction?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "I was initially drawn to a career in IT because of my passion for cyber security. The field itself is ever-changing, especially cyber security, as it is the backbone of IT; I think of it as this “you wouldn't build a building without a lock on all the doors; therefore, you wouldn't build an app without its security measures."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"So, can you tell us; What other kinds of work do you do, within the IT Industry?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "I have done a lot of Bug bounty hunting; this is where I act as a 'middle-man' to try and detect bugs in software and address cyber vulnerabilities that the client is facing; it's nothing malicious; it's usually to mitigate the risk and attempt to fix what they've done, depending on the severity."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Thomas]: <strong>"Can you please tell us  a bit about your interactions with other IT professionals?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "Daily, it pretty much varies. I often spend time in forums and discord chats with other hackers because the industry is growing ridiculously fast, and I don't mean that as job opportunities; I mean software for hacking is becoming more readily available, so we are growing and talking every day. I speak to other ethical hackers. Regarding conversations with developers, my interactions are on stack overflow, sometimes; I'll sit and help with code there. In my security job, most of my interactions are limited because developers sit and do their own thing unless there's an update that is coming or I found something, or I've got something that could help the other developers I don't usually talk to them on my day-to-day efforts, so most of my interactions are with other hackers, and a small percentage of my interactions are with development teams in my security job."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"What are your interactions with clients or investors?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "Well, that's an interesting question, so when it comes to clients, in terms of like my consultancy, it is tough for me to be able to stand and communicate with the client in layman's terms, if somebody asked me 'what's wrong with my server' I can't explain it to an average person, so my interactions, for the most part, are done through my wife. When it comes to clients, because I can't physically talk to them in person, however, if they were to call me, it's a lot easier. 
          Although, I speak primarily with clients about any infrastructure issues, network latency, general stability of the application, and any concerns they have because I have a full stack background. If there are no other developers available, I can jump in and have a quick conversation with them on how to fix what they're going through, and that's pretty much it.
          Although most developers will barely ever speak to an investor, I have had to talk to an investor once in my entire career. That was simply an 'OK; we're looking at investing additional money in terms of security. Do we need to invest more on your side, or do you need to have more access?'"
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Thomas]: <strong>"What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "Most of my work is analytics, and I mean analytics in the general sense; I spend roughly 16 to 29 hours just looking at how people behave and interact with our systems, i.e., frequent traffic points and that sort of stuff, as it helps me get a better idea of where I should redirect my following efforts, I like to use the old saying 'measure twice, cut once'.
          Other than that, I probably say most of my efforts go towards security monitoring and analytics; those two are the most significant aspects I spend my time on. I don't spend anywhere near as much time as I would like to on pen testing."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"Which aspects of your work are most challenging for you?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "I would personally have to say the people. I have heard from other developers that they also agree “that most challenging part is the people” because, in IT, you’re taught to speak in a certain way, you don't even realise it, but when someone comes up to you and says an algorithm they may be thinking 'X+Y so on'. However, you're just thinking of a set of rules your programme must follow, so our interpretation as IT professionals differs from standard people.
          When I was a freelancer, explaining to somebody that 'the code will not work for what they want' and the price that they're asking for to them adding a spinning wheel on a loading point is straightforward. In contrast, you can understand that it's not going to work timewise, infrastructure-wise, or general supply-wise, so there's just a barrier of understanding, and to puncture that barrier, you need a lot of patience. Unfortunately, I don't have that."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"Finally, we would like to be able to share an example of your work; can you share an example of work you have done that best captures the essence of the IT Industry?"</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: It is my view that the IT industry should represent integrity and innovation so my best reflection of that would be Bug Bounty Hunting and my work in expanding cyber security awareness within my company.”
          “I also have a link to my  <a href="https://github.com/AstroAspie" target="_blank" class="underline">GitHub</a> where you can see the different projects I have worked on over my years."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Jo]: <strong>"Alex, thank you very much for doing this."</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Thomas]: <strong>"Yeah, thanks for doing that."</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          [Alex]: "No that was fun, thank you for thinking to ask me, I've never done something like this in a professional capacity so I really enjoyed do it."
        </blockquote>
