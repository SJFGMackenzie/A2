        <p>The name Bravo derived from an early method of finding teams for the course. When it came to choosing our team's name, we chose to stick with Bravo. Over the duration of the assessment, the name Bravo has had some inside jokes, but overall, really does go well with our team and our ideas.</p>
        
        <p>This page introduces each member of team Bravo. For each member you will find the following: Member's Name, a photo, student number (#), the link to each member's individual website, followed by an introduction from each member.</p>

            Hi I'm Jo,
            Born in Victoria, I grew up in a small town marked 'the centre of Victoria'. I'm 36 years old; I have two children, a 14yo son and a 10yo daughter. I wanted to be a paramedic and was very passionate about it. I spent six years as a volunteer First Responder (Advanced First Aid) with St John Ambulance Victoria, including 18 months as a grade IIII operations officer. As a result of my medical diagnosis, I could not continue in the medical field. Therefore, I re-evaluated what I could do, and the outcome happened to be Information Technology (IT). My decision to choose to study IT was very influential. Through conversation with a programmer friend, I began to realise I have a deep underlying interest in the future of technology and how it can help for good.

            Hey, I'm Shay. 
            I was born an Indigenous Australian, with my biological father being Yugoslavian - known today as Serbia - and Maltese. My mother is Indigenous, with Irish in her line as well. Born an angry fighting nerd, my interest in computers was set to be guaranteed. Between the writing, gaming, existential dread and computing, there's not much time for other pastimes, but I make time. Or at least time signatures! I write music in my spare time. It's not good music, but it exists. Other things I like are pizza, swords, and comic sans. My next steps are more University, programming, video game design, law, music, creative writing, history, architecture, finance, and philosophy. There's no such thing as being too qualified, and they say that the Jack-of-All-Trades, Master of None, is better than the Master of One. I still will try and Master at least one.

Throughout my life, I have loved the outdoors and going on adventures with my family to places such as Lorne, The Grampians and Echuca.

            An <strong>Adventurer (ISFP)</strong> is a person with the Introverted (I), Observant (S), Feeling (F), and Prospecting (P) personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.
            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Adventurers are more sensitive to stress and can feel overwhelmed easier than Assertive (A) Adventurers. This characteristic can allow them to see little problems before they become big problems. Though Turbulent Adventurers are likely to feel more comfortable with themselves than the average Turbulent personality type, they are still less at ease in their own lives than Assertive Adventurers.”(Myers-Briggs, no date)

            A <strong>Logistician (ISTJ)</strong>Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted (I), Observant (S), Thinking (T), and Judging (J) personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.
            Unexpected changes bother Logisticians more than any other personality type, and this is especially true for <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logisticians. However, in their ongoing need to improve and with their sense of uncertainty, they may actually be more willing to change, despite a certain amount of distress, than the more settled Assertive (A) Logisticians. Turbulent Logisticians are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to express and act on their emotions than Assertive personality types. The positive side of their more expressive emotions is that they can make them more accessible to others.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

            A <strong>Logician (INTP)</strong> is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.
            Assertive (A) Logicians are likely to be more consistent than <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logicians due to confidence in the choices they make and being less influenced by others.
            Turbulent Logicians change their goals more often than their Assertive cousins. This can make these personalities more flexible problem-solvers – though perhaps too flexible at times.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

        <h2>What these results mean for team Bravo…</h2>
        <p>
          The Myers-Briggs test indeed shows the mixed profile of personalities within our team, while there is a few quite prominent differences, there are several similarities. Five members out of six classed as introverted and only one as an extravert. Half the team are classed as observant while the others intuitive. There are both thinkers and feelers among the group along with most being classed as prospecting with 2 members being the judging character. The varying approaches to things among the group is likely to allow some to work well while others are more reserved and less communicative. The Adventurers of the team have open minds and are present in the moment. Our team leader highlights a much different personality to most being rational, methodical, and unexpected changes are a hassle to this Logistician. The flexible thinking and creativity of our Logician member brings in a different style to the group. The 'Entertainer' of our group, the individual extravert, likes to engage vibrantly and enjoys discovering the unknown. And having an Advocate in the group brings a member who has deep thoughtfulness and imagination, is quiet but uses these traits to provide successful outcomes (Myers-Briggs, no date). All members are of the Turbulent trait. Although this means something different to each personality type, this allows Bravo, as a team, to combine their abilities to overcome small issues before they become big. An ongoing need for improvement adds to the drive of the group, especially in a team leader. Further, flexibility in problem solving is important in any group and with an ability to hold attention on difficult matters the team extrovert may just come in needed. Finally having the traits of a worry-led Advocate could push the final outcome of the team assessment due to the need to focus on difficult parts of a problem (Myers-Briggs, no date). Overall, the combined traits amongst the members of team Bravo, although quite varied, blend reasonably. The team had built its hierarchy before understanding this combined information, yet the positions held would match the traits explained in the results of the personality test.

        <h2>What these results mean for team Bravo...</h2>
        <p>
          Team Bravo's six members tend to have varied however blending learning styles. With the team leader standing out with Kinaesthetic learning, other members seem to be a mix of auditory, visual, and tactile learners. Having a mixture of learning styles within a group is certainly beneficial to a team as all members bring a mix of abilities and ideas. The team appears to communicate well and each member is comfortable with their positions in the team. Work seems to come together easy and the combination of learning style, skill and differing knowledge just seems to mould the groups work efforts with ease.

I also scored highly on agreeableness which I also expected; I tend to avoid confrontation; therefore, I try my best to cooperate and get along with others. I did score low in extraversion which would be a result of my history, I would much rather spend time alone or with a small group of close friends, than with a large group."

          "In the Big Five Personality Test I scored 100% on agreeableness, which reiterates I am easy to get along with and work well in a team. While also scoring between 80-90% with Conscientiousness, Openness and Neuroticism, from this I understand through my tendency to experience high negative feelings especially in self-consciousness, having awareness of my feelings drives my need to have control over the success of things. Scoring low in extraversion is an unfortunate result of my social history, however I do score high in assertiveness and cheerfulness which explains I do like to speak out and take charge and typically share enthusiasm and optimism and generally convey a positive mood."

          "I'm more feeling than I expected, in that I am more emotion sensitive than I was prepared to face. I get to take a look in a different way to teammates, who might be more logical, thinking and involved in projects. The way I can make myself less feeling, and become a better logical thinker is possibly to take more time with logic puzzles."

          "What I find so fascinating about the results is the extraversion results. I do not consider myself to be much of an extravert. It says I have a high score for assertiveness; however, I do not believe I speak out as much as these results suggest I do. However, I do agree with the rest of the results, as I have found myself to being open and friendly with others, non-aggressive. Always agreeable and avoiding conflict whenever possible. I always strive to keep a clear mind and consider solutions before acting if it serves for better results. Overall, the test seems to be a good representation of who I am to a degree."

          "In the Big Five Personality test, I scored highly in Agreeableness showing that I am expected to choose to cooperate with others rather than compete with them, and that I have a great deal of empathy. While scoring low in areas such as openness, This I feel is rather accurate to how I believe myself to be, I find myself often being the type of person who would suppress their own feelings or push them aside to try to help another person to be happy."

          "In my big 5 personality test I scored a 15/20 in my trust. Based on the Big 5 test “A person with high trust assumes that most people are fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust see others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous”. So based on the result and definition, I am a very trustful person who can be left with tasks or secrets and would not often break someone's trust in me."

      <h2>What this means for team Bravo...</h2>
      <p>
        Among the six members of team Bravo, all members scored quite high percentages in Agreeableness with all members scoring between 75-100%. The ease in which we were able to form our team and delegate tasks with no issues has been a result of the agreeableness within the team. Openness however seen much lower percentage scores for majority of team members, with only 1 scoring high and rest of team between 70-85%. This has created low communication levels from some members. Extraversion was reasonably low throughout the team, and although conscientiousness scored a wide variety of percentage, neither of these traits got a high score from members of team Bravo. Neuroticism seen the other 2 members of the team's highest percentages', again, though varying, most members were in a higher percentage of neuroticism. (Rubynor, no date) Bravo's members tend to have many different traits which seem to have worked reasonably well in the early stages of teamwork.
