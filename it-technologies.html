        <h3>Cloud Computing Services</h3>
        <span>Written by Jo Stammers and Thomas Kauran</span>
        <p>
          This section of the report will discuss Cloud, Servers and Services. It will discuss what cloud and servers are and the services that are provided. Following, will continue to explain the most remarkable aspects of cloud computing and a detailed explanation of what can be done using cloud computing now. Additionally, it will touch on what is upcoming for cloud computing along with what developments have an impact on the progress. Further, it will go on to explain the impact of cloud computing.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Cloud and what does it do?</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud is simply a model of computing, it is “the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet” (Amazon AWS, no date). Resources include access to servers and networks, storage, development tools and applications (apps) that originally would need to be stored and accessed from privately owned and managed on hard drives and servers (Accenture, no date). Cloud Servers, known as Virtual Servers, are stable and fast and secure. They have all the software they require to run and can be accessed remotely via a cloud computing platform (Probrand, no date). There are two types of cloud computing, deployment models and service categories. Deployment models consist of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud. Service categories include, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (Accenture, no date).

        </p>

        <h4>What are the most remarkable points of using cloud?</h4>
        <p>
          The ability to gain real-time access, on a global scale, to many services via use of the internet is cloud computing's greatest aspect. Deployment Models are a stand-out feature and the first selection to consider when choosing the services a business requires,
        </p>

            Deploy Models
          </span>
        </div>
        <p>
          this is followed by choosing the Service Category (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) (Accenture, no date). 
        </p>
        <div class="polaroid">

            Cloud Types
          </span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Cloud computing eliminates a large portion of the cost of purchasing hardware and software, the cost of running hardware and reduces number of IT staff required to manage infrastructure. The speed at which substantial amounts of resources can be accessed gives business flexibility and ease of capacity planning. Cloud services are accessed on a global scale allowing an elastic scaling, meaning more or less computing power, storage or bandwidth is delivered as required, furthering that power to save more on cost. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, a secure network of data centers are regularly upgraded to latest fast and efficient hardware, these data centers hosts the biggest of the cloud computing services eg. Azure, AWS, Google cloud. Another major benefit, also relieving costs and workload, is the productivity of using cloud computing; the need for hardware setup, software patching and many other time-consuming management responsibilities are irradicated. Further, the reliability of cloud computing makes business continuity, data backup and disaster recovery easier and less expensive and this is achievable by mirroring data on the provider's network (Azure, no date). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Cloud Computing Security has become its own discipline (BeyondTrust, no date). To help protect data, apps and infrastructure, providers usually offer a broad set of policies, include required technologies and controls to strengthen you overall security (Azure, no date).
        </p>

        <h4>What can be done now?</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud services is powering customer innovation. Data Flair (no date) Identifies the 10 features of cloud computing, the following image displays these.
        </p>

        <div class="polaroid">

          <span class="polaroid-details">
            Cloud Features
          </span>
        </div>

        <p>
          Such features create benefits for both host and customers. The current possibilities using cloud computing are, creating cloud-native apps; test and build applications; store, back up and recover data; analyse data; deliver software on demand; communication; stream audio and video; embed intelligence (Azure, no date).
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>"…it has become the ideal medium for testing and development, communication, storage and deployment of software." (DigitalCloud Training, no date) </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Microsoft (Azure), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alibaba (Alicloud) and Google (Google Cloud), known as MAAGs are the four main cloud service providers, these providers enable massive scaling and therefore named hyperscalers (Accenture, no date). Hyperscale cloud service providers (eg. Infosys, Atos, IBM, Oracle, etc.) are entities that use one or multiple of the hyperscalers to consult, design, develop, build and manage software, data and applications (Martin; Gabriel, 2021).
        </p>

        <h4>What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4>

        <p>
          Hyperscalers have been working on private cloud extensions. In the future it is likely that 'public cloud' and 'private cloud' will blend into a hybrid cloud umbrella, eventually phasing and instead being identified as 'dedicated' and 'shared' (Accenture, no date). Data Flare (no date) reported that researchers have proved that Cloud Computing will a leading technology in the future. Cloud computing requires modified software (Modular Sofware), this software will be more flexible and user-friendly and will provide much better facilities and security. Cloud computing is very cost-effective, powerful and expansive and will continue to grow and improve.
        </p>

        <h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>

        <p>
          Tech giants are looking to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process data and improve business functioning. With the use of AI, the efficiency of computing platforms is increasing. The future of cloud is heavily relying on ensuring users have a secure system to work with. DevSecOps is the process thinking of the infrastructure security from the start. DevSecOps will work on automating core security tasks and does this by embedding security controls into the workflow. Moreover, the service mesh is another critical component in cloud computing, the service mesh provides a safe communication environment by dedicating users a layer for service-to-service communication, which in turn creates a highly dynamic and secure platform. Additionally, Open-source cloud is providing a path of innovation and collaboration, it is a service built with software or technology that can be customized, allowing customers to customize infrastructure based on specific needs (Rapyder, 2021).
        </p>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>

        <p>
          The impact of cloud computing has had on the world of IT is tremendous. It has, in some way, impacted on almost every individual alive today. Education, social, health, navigation, shopping, or business are just a few examples. Cloud computing could be considered a revolutionary change to how data is stored, maintained, and made available across the world to any device with internet connection. From smart devices such as a fridge, watch, home entertainment system to a more powerful device such as a laptop or mobile phone, everything has access to the cloud with an internet connection. This has made a large impact on the lives of countless of the worlds' population (Willber, 2020). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Although it is difficult to predict the future of cloud computing, the work of the hyperscalers is likely to bring further ease of access, usage and maintenance to a varied but targeted range of users (Accenture, no date). Implementing the modular software will allow a greater plethora of functionality that will not only enrich business, but also the target audience of their products or services (DataFlare, no date). The impact of cloud computing is worldwide and is almost at a point it defines our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has impacted how businesses and organizations can manage their systems and data, but also how their customers access services (Willber, 2020). Cloud computing is what allows our homes and lives to be filled with the technologies available today. For businesses, the major beneficial effects are noticed are when comparing cloud computing to traditional computing, with the use of cloud services, businesses no longer need to develop or purchase software or purchase and maintain hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cloud service providers remotely provide management tasks, relieving the need for staffed or contracted technicians to fix technical problems (Watson, 2016). Additionally, individuals reap just as many benefits, cloud services have enabled the lives we live today. From entertainment, social/communication platforms, real-time access of cloud-based apps, navigation, online shopping, and personal storage are all services provided by cloud computing services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further, cloud computing has boosted the access and flexibility for the way education is delivered and the healthcare system has adopted cloud computing technology to manage, store and share patient information, allowing the individual and multiple health care professional to access information (Willber, 2020). Cloud services being adapted by a business or organization is described by Watson, 2016. as causing a shift in the structure of the organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The structure would create a significant workload shift leaving individuals with new responsibilities. Positions such as managers and customer relationship managers would be replaced by cloud services which ensure workers have access to all that is needed for their work criteria. It would also replace the jobs with responsibility of software and hardware within an organization (Watson, 2016).
        </p>

        <h4>How will Cloud Computing affect your daily lives?</h4>

        <p>
          Individually each team member may have varying response to how cloud affects them.
          One example is that one of us own a home security system that links several security cameras to a device that records and saves those recordings for several weeks. The device also allows the feed to be viewed from another device such as a computer or mobile phone. The affect the individual is that they can feel safe and secure knowing that when they come home, they can likely be certain no one is on their property and can have peace of mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          All before they step foot inside their home thanks to the live feed being available to them on their phone.
          Another example would be the project idea that our team has decided to move forward with. To create a mental health service available to male military veterans in Australia, and other emergency services. This service will be built on-top of cloud computing services to make the service available to anyone who needs it. With the use of technologies such as EC2 servers, S3 buckets and DynamoDB (All amazon cloud computing services) just to name a few.
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally, we can assume that as each team member continues their studies and eventually their careers in IT. each of us will continue to in turn work with cloud computing services in some form whether it is through building services on cloud computing infrastructure or using services that are built on top of cloud computing infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h4>What will be different for you?</h4>
        <p>
          The more each team member becomes familiar with cloud computing and the underlying technology, the more proficient we will become and more desirable our skillsets will be too. This will allow for each of us to use the technology in building portfolios to show potential employers, or clients and showcase our knowledge to obtain work, whether it be contracted work or full-time employment.

        </p>

        <p>
          Another impact may be that our lives become more invaded through concerns of privacy as more devices appear around us, and we have no knowledge of what these devices may do secretly, such as listening into conversation under the guise of “improving services”, recording the data we input to a device and companies using this information to “improve their services” as mentioned above.
        </p>

        <h4>
          How might this affect members of your family or friends?
        </h4>

        <p>
          Family and friends will likely already be impacted, and if not, are destined to be impacted in the future by the use of cloud services improving their lives. Whether it's through online shopping, social and communication platforms or through entertainment such as streaming services and online radio etc., along with the advancing use within health and education systems allows for greater access an. 
          Cloud computing is everywhere in the lives of most people alive today.

        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
        <span>Written by Shay Hammond, Nathen Hogan and Jo Stammers</span>
        <h4>What is Cybersecurity and what does it do?</h4>
        <p>
          Cyber security is one of the world's most used functions of worldwide networks. Also, one of the most flawed, and easily manipulated markets. Its main purpose is to hide sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card data, phone numbers, location settings and more. Because of such an important job that cyber security plays, it is more prone to people accessing the data they didn't get explicit permission to access. The people who prey on its systems are the people who understand its integral core functions. These people are known as hackers. 
        </p>

        <h4>what can be done now?</h4>

        <p>
          Some of the most common and versatile ways people interface with the cyber security world are via malicious connections against personal data. This sort of connection without known consent is called an “attack”. There are different types of attacks, some much more obvious than others. 
        </p>

        <p>
          How often have you opened your emails, and seen an email from a site that you trust offering you a gift card or free present, and all they need is your details? Quite commonly, most just click away, press block or spam, or just delete the email. But very occasionally, someone will agree and click through, and not even consider that it's a scam because “it came from a trusted site…right?” Wrong. This kind of attack is called a “phishing” attack, as it lures you in, convinces you to bite and hooks onto your data or information and reels it in. Apologies for the terrible puns, but this is quite literally what the attack does. 
        </p>

        <p>
          A similar attack usually starts the same way - opening a harmless email from a "trusted site", clicking the link to download the “coupon code” and then suddenly - a virus creeps inside and corrupts your system. This type of attack is called a malware attack. It infects your computer ware - hardware or software - with a dangerous and destructive virus. Some viruses don't actively do anything - simply read your data and send it off to its point of origin. Others actively destroy your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes, clicking that innocent email is all that's needed, as the hacker is already connected to the stream of communication, and acts as a “man-in-the-middle”, collecting information already passing through from you and your computer to the server of the website. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe you don't even need to think about opening your emails at all, as you can't access them. Why? Because a hacker has already gotten to your password. 
          "But how" - I hear you cry - "as I have a super secure password that I haven't told anyone!" 
          The thing to know about hackers is that plenty of them have time and money, and programs that can scan for passwords, and if your password is simple enough to find, they will find it. 
          The question then is; “how can I protect myself, and my users if I'm developing a site that lets them connect with people?” 
          A very specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-limited question. A SMART question if you will. If you won't… then okay I'll move on. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the most common and reliable ways to protect data - especially in user-to-user via server communication - is through the help of firewalls. Firewalls are essentially traffic blocks that only let the secure information go through, by analysing which points are the safest on both ends and allowing or denying specific points of reference. Should the data be deemed safe from one user, the information passes through and gets delivered from the server. From there, it is checked again and delivered to the other user.
        </p>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <span>By Nathen Hogan</span>

        <p>
          The use of Cybersecurity is extremely beneficial to society as a whole, while being especially beneficial towards the IT industry, due to the ever increasing plague of the industry that is Cybercrime and the difficulty that comes with both the detection and prevention of this, with this comes the constant evolution and research of Cybersecurity to respond to and prevent the use of cyber-attacks, which becomes even more important with the daily increased reliance on technology of society with no end to this incline in sight.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this constant development of cybersecurity comes the use of new tools to both industry and individuals assisting in the protection of your personal data, a common example of this is the use of 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) to most platforms today, 2FA is a process of requiring users to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves (SearchSecurity, n.d.), this normally being the use of another linked device to provide a code after entering your passwords, As well as other authentication implementations such as Biometric, certificate-based and token-based authentications(Maayan, 2020). 
        </p>

        <p>
          With added security from these innovations, you are to expect an increase in consumer trust due to the decreased risk of information breaches causing their data to be leaked possibly leading to identity theft, as well as industries feeling more secure in their own infrastructure (Verizon Enterprise, n.d.). Coming with the increase in cybersecurity development comes an increased need for jobs to keep up with the workflow of not only further development but also with maintaining the platforms that come from said development.
        </p>

        <h4>How will Cybersecurity affect your daily lives?</h4>

        <p>
          Cybersecurity essentially keeps us safe to an extent from malicious attacks, protecting our devices and data from unwanted prying eyes. It allows us to continue to do the things we enjoy doing online, allows businesses to safely and securely carry out their business without fear of data breaches, and lets us carry out.

        <h3>Machine Learning </h3>
        <span>Written by Nathen Hogan</span>
        <h4>what does it do?</h4>
        <p>Machine learning is at its core the use of AI or “artificial intelligence” to create programs that can develop and expand upon their own pattern recognition based on user input as well as stored data from either the user or the data stored by the software itself to better understand what the users want and need, without the developer needing to specifically program the specific task. It does this by imitating the way humans learn, over time and gradually adapting and evolving based on its experiences, there are many types of machine learning that impact the way the program achieves this, to name the most common types: </p>
        <p>Supervised learning, the developer must monitor and assist the machine in order to train it to work on its own by providing it with labelled training data sets. </p>
        <p>unsupervised learning, similar to the above but without labelled training data sets. </p>
        <p>reinforcement learning, the system learns almost entirely on its own </p>
      
        <p>Machine learning is used in an extreme amount of systems and programs that are used on a daily basis in all areas of technology such as: </p>
        <p>Virtual assistants on your computer and mobile devices use machine learning to detect when you are talking to them, as well as collect and utilize data based on your day to day interactions with them in order to better understand your needs and give results better tailored to your preferences. </p>
        <p>Google has multiple uses of machine learning, some of which are gathering of information from your searches and visits to better target ads that cater to your needs and wants, as well as using popular search terms from yourself as well as others to attempt to predict what are looking for by either auto filling your search or pushing results better relating to your search terms to the top of the web page. </p>
        <p>PayPal uses machine learning as a means of fraud detection, to compare millions of transactions to determine whether the purchase is legitimate or illegitimate  </p>
      
        <p>Recently there has been massive advancements in a machine learning ai program that was already something leaps ahead of its competitors, This open source Api named “dall-e-2 (https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) is a program that takes user input and creates a unique image based off of a collection of data that the system has scanned from the internet that closely matches the key terms, often creating unique pieces of art that are almost indistinguishable from something made from human development. </p>
        <p>The future of machine learning is likely to continue to grow at an exponential rate,  with the continued every day use making machine learning a staple for most systems, this leads to constant discoveries and improvements in the field, although machine learning is not like other fields, due to the nature of machine learning itself the speed at which it advances is much more volatile than other fields, its common place that one minute something  ground breaking has been newly discovered and the next minute there is a new discovery makes that seem mundane “We all heard of Open AI’s GPT-2, and a few months later GPT-3 pushed the boundaries of what is possible and shook the entire internet in disbelief” (Tarek Amr ,Słupski, n.d.), with advances like these being common place its not hard to believe that something like a road of fully autonomous driving vehicles would be possible in the not too distant future, it is estimated that  “20% of new cars sales in China in 2030 will be for autonomous vehicles” (Liberty Advisor Group, n.d.).</p>
        <p>Advancements in 5G technology are of great assistance to this,  network connectivity plays a critical role in the development of self driving vehicles, with better connectivity comes the possibility of making them faster, smarter and safer. “5G technology enables car connectivity so vehicles can connect to everything – other vehicles, the infrastructure, network services, and other road users. 5G is a critical enabler to all these technologies. Fast networks and connectivity allow autonomous cars to move around safely in the real world” (Liberty Advisor Group, n.d.). </p>
      
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <p>Machine learning has made a large impact on the world and the way society has evolved, from media to healthcare and commerce, all aspects of life will in some way be streamlined by the continued use and evolution of machine learning, you will be more likely to find a business or application that doesn’t in corporate machine learning in some fashion than you would the alternative, this isn’t without its negatives though as due to this people may feel like they have their privacy being taken away, and this isn’t entirely false either, due to all the data that is needed for machine learning to function correctly, business’s and the government will certainly know more about you and your day to day activities and interests than you intend for them to know, this information is often sold or traded off even further to other business’s and corporations that you hadn’t initially intended your data to be in possession of, making your digital finger print even greater and contributing to the targeted mass marketing potential of these businesses, I saw a perfect analogy for this on social media funnily enough “Modern society operates similarly to open source” </p>
      
        <h4>How will this affect you? </h4>
        <p>One prime example of how daily life can and already has started to be affected in my household is the use of machine learning in personal assistants, assisted with the use of other peripheral devices such as Wi-Fi connected lights as well as power point adapters, this has allowed me to hook my Google home personal assistant to these devices and then speak to my assistant telling to turn these devices on and off, or simply asking for a recipe while cooking or setting a timer for something to be ready all with the power of machine learning allowing the device to recognize my voice. </p>
        <p>Another application that affects myself as well as most of society on a daily basis is the use of machine learning for things like personally customized adds based on my searches and frequent website visits, more often than not this is accurate and helpful to what you may actually want or need. </p>
      
        <p>As further development of machine learning goes on its likely that the use of automation in day-to-day activities will become even more prominent, I expect myself to have near full automation to most utilities within my home in the near future, throughout my studies I also expect that I will get more knowledge and experience within this area in order to implement machine learning into projects that I do in the future. </p>
      
        <p>In most common ways family and friends will likely already be affected by machine learning in the basic ways described prior, since personal assistants are a staple for mobile phone technology and personalized ads also being a staple of web content, and if they are not already it's unlikely for them to avoid this happening with machine learning being as close as it can be to a necessity in today's technological society. </p>

        <h4>What is a raspberry pi and what does it do?</h4>
        <p>
          Raspberry Pi's are essentially a minicomputer. They are a powerful, easy to use computer that can play out all the functions of a standard computer; from programming , to browsing the web, watching HD videos, even playing games, word processing and making spreadsheets. However, the device is as small as a credit card, connects to a monitor or TV and any standard keyboard and mouse (RaspberryPi, no date).

        <h5>Raspberry Pi Pico</h5>
        <p>
          Pico is Raspberry Pi’s flagship microcontroller. It is a small, fast and versatile board, built using RP2040. Pico gives you power to control IoT devices, light displays, manufacturing processes or signage and more. 
          Pico is programmable in C and MicroPython making it adaptable to a large range of applications and skill levels. More experienced programmers can make use of the custom peripheral support, which includes SPI, I2C and 8 programmable I/O (PIO) state machine (RaspberryPi, no date).

          Other Poducts currently available are add-ons which allow you to do things such as; connect to LEGO Technic motors; powr over ethernet; audio out-put; and more. Also available are Power and USB cables; cases for all Raspberry Pi's 1-4; and peripherals. There are also numerous compute modules.

        <h4>What can be done now?</h4>

        <p>
          There are thousands of online project guides that are easy to follow, and available ranging from ultra-beginner to expert. There is a wide variety of purposes Raspberry Pi’s can be used for. OS’s (Operating Systems), usually Linux-based, have been created, ranging from desktop setups, game consoles, media systems, server systems and heaps more (Angove-Plum, 2022). With Raspberry Pi’s opportunities are endless. Using a Linux-based OS and Python programming language, Raspberry Pies can be used to develop Wesites, web application or GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications. Level of knowledge does not matter with Raspberry Pi as it is designed to be a learning tool, to teach system and language though project engagement (Piday, no date). Each of the Raspberry Pi devices available heave different level of capacities, some with wireless network capabilities, others without.

        <p>
          Piday (no date) suggested some projects that can be accomplished using a Raspberry Pi, these included; environmental monitors eg. Temperature and humidity; informational displays, work clocks, airplay speakers, retro games and others. Later versions and further experience we see you creating projects such as; build a home theatre PC, run dual HD monitors or build a home security system. Piday's article says, “One of the most impressive aspects of Raspberry Pi is the amount and variety of support available to users of Raspberry Pi” (Piday, no date).
        </p>

        <h4>What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3 years?)</h4>
        <p>
          This is an interesting question because the only real limit to raspberry pi's is how powerful their hardware is, anything you can do with a normal computer, would likely be possible with a raspberry pi if the hardware is powerful enough to complete the same tasks. 
          Currently with a raspberry pi you could build several things such as temperature and weather sensors, appliances, robots, cameras etc. So, in the next three years you could possibly be building more powerful and larger robots, appliances that have far more features and are more performant etc. 
          Raspberry pi's are truly only limited by their hardware limitations, not so much their form factors.
        </p>

        <h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>

        <p>
          Break throughs in manufacturing of hardware are what make this technology possible, every year scientists and engineers are working on creating newer hardware technologies trying to decrease the form factor of computer chips while adding more features and increasing their performance.
          This ties very closely with Moore's law however, which states that integrated circuits double roughly every two years which has since been slowing down for a few years and will continue to diminish until new break throughs are made (MIQ Partners, no date).
