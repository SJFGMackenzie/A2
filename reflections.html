      <h2>Group Reflections</h2>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
        <h4>What went well?</h4>
        <p>
          As a group we believe we have achieved a great amount of success with our second assignment, as a team we have spent many hours both in meetings and individually working towards reaching a project idea that not only meets the minimum requirements but goes beyond what is expected. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When a team member has had struggles completing a designated task, one or more members have been there to aid us, in this regard one member has stood out, Shay and we appreciate the hard work she has put in to be the clue that holds the group together.
        </p>

        <h4>What could be improved?</h4>

        <p>
          We believe that it is important for the group learn our tools better so that we may have an easier time communicating with one another, but also in creating more outstanding work within our third assignment. The group will be dedicating some of their time individually to learning Microsoft teams, Trello, and GitHub to further their skills not only in this subject, but for their future studies and careers in IT. 
        </p>

        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, on Tuesday the 12th of July 2022, the team's leader Stephan left the Group's Microsoft Teams without saying a word or messaging a member. The group found this too surprising to believe at first because it was what we all believed to be out of character for Stephan. 
          We emailed Anthony asking for him to contact Stephan to find out what had happened, and if everything was alright as the team believed something must have gone wrong, and that he may not have been ok. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To the groups surprise however Anthony contacted Stephan and it turns out he could no longer continue to study with the group for reasons unknown to us. 
          This has been difficult for the group and caused many issues for us as he left in the final week before submission for assignment two. 
        </p>

        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>

        <p>
          For most of the group, this is their first-time being part of a group in university studies. Two members, Jo and Thomas have previously been in a few project-based subjects and have already experienced the lows and highs that come with working within a group. 
          So as a team the majority of us have learned that communication can be an issue sometimes, some team members may take offense and leave if a misunderstanding occurs and, in the end it is best to be clear and concise with one another to come together as a group and produce the best work we can together.

      <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>

        <h3>Thomas Kauran</h3>

        <h4>What went well?</h4>

        <p>
          Coming together as a group to coordinate meetings, agendas and taking meeting notes. Not many people missed a meeting, and when they did it was an unfortunate accident. The team works well together to complete tasks for assignment two and overall have a good cohesion.
        </p>

        <h4>What could be improved?</h4>

        <p>
          There is plenty that could be improved. Team coordination in Microsoft Teams and GitHub would be a start. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the Groups creation Stephan had created the groups repository and got to work before I could set any ground rules, and in my own naivety decided it would be a good lesson for the team to learn what can go wrong when a repository is badly managed, and I am now currently in the process of fixing that issue before the deadline. 
        </p>

        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>
          I did not expect to lose our group leader toward the end of assignment two without a word to any group member.
        </p>

        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>

        <p>
          That things can go wrong very quickly without warning. Groups need to learn to voice their opinions with tact and understand that no one's out to hurt anyone else. This had the adverse effect of creating some panic and confusion within both the team and I as we were unsure of why he had abruptly left the group. It also caused the team to fall behind with the second assignment, because we had one less member to help with completing the assignment, and the project idea chosen was mainly Stephan's original idea but changed to suit the group, with pieces from Jo, Shay, and my own project ideas also.

        <h3>Jo Stammers</h3>
        <h4>What went well?</h4>
        <p>
          Our team was formed quite quickly, in fact, four members had already teamed up prior to it being necessary, the other 2 added early in week 4 (first week of A2) and this happened during our course-wide lecture with Anthony and he confirmed our group. I realised on the weekend of week 4 we were supposed to have at least 1 recorded meeting per week, so quickly arranged a time available to everyone and our first meeting was successfully held on the Sunday of week 4. From there we held meetings twice a week on set days of Tuesday and Sunday which all members were usually in attendance unless purely incidental due to unforeseen circumstances. In general most of the team communicated well. Otherwise, I don't think anything really went well except for Thomas and myself scraping together, what we could in time to deliver.

        <h4>What went well?</h4>
        <p>
          I feel like the way we organised and the way that we distributed the work went really well and worked efficiently. As a team we consistently held group meetings and successfully discussed how to smash this assignment out of the park which I feel that we have done and in doing so set ourselves up perfectly for assignment 3. 
        </p>
        <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
        <p>
          I feel that some of us (me included) weren't really experts at some tools and programs like others in our group are, which affected our groups way of getting work done as tasks took longer than needed. One other thing that could be improved is the location of our work. Throughout the assignment I constantly didn't know where work was or what work need to be done. I feel that in assignment 3 we need to be clearer. 
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
        <p>
          The one thing that I found surprising is how well a group worked straight out the gate at the beginning of the assignment. I thought it was going to start slow and that we wouldn't communicate as much but luckily it was the opposite and we all communicated frequently. 
        </p>
        <h4>
          At least one thing that you have learned about groups?
        </h4>

        <p>
          The one thing I've learnt about groups is that everyone is different. Everyone has different lives, jobs, hobbies and ways of learning. Some people may get work done faster as that they do not have many commitments and others may do 3 different things but slowly but still get it done. I learnt that it is important to not question peoples' methods on how they get things done but instead to support them the best they can in how the complete tasks

        <h4>What went well?</h4>
        <p>
          As a group we successfully set out tasks that the members assigned to has at least a small interest in which assisted in the efficiency of the research for each section, our group was rather punctual only having very few moments where someone had missed or been late for a meeting. 
        </p>
        <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
        <p>
          Knowledge of the platforms and tools we use in which to store and compile our work together could be further improved so all members have a better understanding of what they can and can't do as well as how.  
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
        <p>
          Surprising to me was that one of our members whom I thought to be someone who was very punctual, determined for the work and clicked with everyone well had just up and vanished without a word as to where or why.

        </h4>
        <p>
          As this being my first group activity in university study, I learned that clear communication is the most important aspect that needs to be extremely prominent, or things can very quickly fall into unorganized chaos.
